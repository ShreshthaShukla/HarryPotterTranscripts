# HarryPotterTranscripts
As the entertainment industry grows exponentially every day, we see an increase in sequels of movies. The time span between a movie series of say 5 movies, is a lot. The task of relating to different storylines and relationships between different characters over the course of the movies, becomes cumbersome as the number of movies in the series increase. Our project will take into consideration the Harry Potter movie series, and will attempt to provide a better insight on the complex relationships between different characters and events that have transpired over the course of 8 movies.
